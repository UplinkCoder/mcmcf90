Installation instructions for the mcmc f90 library

1. Read Readme.txt

2. Check the Makefile

3. Run make

4. Copy libmcmcrun.a to /usr/local/lib/, for example, or keep it where
   it is now.

5. Check example fortran code mcmcrun.F90 in the 'testcases' directory.

The calculations use BLAS and LAPACK routines so your code needs to be linked
with these, in addition to libmcmcrun.a.

If you want to use the utilities in the library other than
mcmc_main(), your code needs to have access to the generated
*.mod files during the compilation.
